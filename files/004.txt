Eating is Tiger's favorite. He likes fish and vegetables, especially mackerel and sweet potato leaves. His grandma prepares steamed mackerel for him from time to time. Every time he saw that, he will devour it. Maybe because he used to stray on the street, he knows what vegetables can help him vomit his own fur. He might find sweet potato leaves is most delicious or helpful. As a result, his grandma grows sweet potatoes especially for him. He is just like a prince in my family.

Like most cats in the world, Tiger likes canned food, especially seafood flavor such as fish and crab. From meal to meal, sometimes we give him a cat can as a snack, he also devour it quickly. However, he won't eat it all at one time because he used to leave some in case there's no food for next meal. He really knows how to enjoy the cans. One time I saw him to have cat food and a cat can at the same time just like we have dishes with rice.

吃東西是小虎的最愛。他喜歡魚跟蔬菜，特別是鯖魚跟番薯葉。他奶奶偶爾會準備清蒸鯖魚給他，每次他都狼吞虎嚥吃完。也許是因為他曾經在街上流浪，他知道那些蔬菜可以幫助他吐毛。他可能是發現番薯最好吃或最有效吧？因此他奶奶會自己種番薯葉給他吃。在我家，他就像一個王子！

就像世界上大部分的貓咪，小虎也喜歡罐罐，特別是魚蟹之類的海鮮口味。偶爾在正餐之間，我們會給他罐罐當點心，他也會狼吞虎嚥地吃。但是他不會一次吃完，因為他習慣留一些以防下一餐沒有食物吃。他也很懂怎麼享受罐罐。有一次我看到他邊吃飼料邊吃罐罐，就好像我們人吃飯要配菜一樣。
