Tiger cured everyone in my family with his lovely and gentle personality. I encountered something unfair at school when I was a senior high school, my parents could not listen to me carefully and fight for me precisely. As a result, our relationship had became a little distant during my university period. However, Tiger's coming not only helped my parents survive from the empty nest period but also let us have a lot common topics again. It definitely fixed our relationship.

The event happened during my high school period actually affected how I view the world. A mental trauma event may be just once, but it is still bleeding blood when similar situations occur. Every time I feel depressed, Tiger always leans on me and accompanies me quietly. He comforted my pain in my life, and now I can control myself not to make unwise decisions due to bad experiences. Thanks to Tiger, I am still living normally. Thousands of words cannot present my appreciation for him.

Tiger, I wish I can meet you again. Good bye!

小虎用他可愛又溫柔的個性療癒了我們家的每個人。我讀高中的時候遇到社會不公的事，我的雙親當時沒有聽懂我的心聲，所以也沒有為我精準地爭取。因此在我大學時期，我們的關係變得有點疏離。但是小虎的出現不僅讓他們順利度過空巢期，也讓我們擁有了共通的話題，這無疑地修補了我們的關係。

高中發生的事情確實地影響了我的世界觀。心理創傷可能是一時的，但每當遭遇相似情境，它還是會滲血。每當我感到憂鬱，小虎總是會靠著我的身體然後靜靜地陪伴我。他撫慰了我生命中的痛苦，讓我現在可以不再因為往日的陰影做出不智的決定。多虧了小虎，我現在還好好活著。千言萬語都不足以表達我對他的感謝。

小虎，期待與你再度重逢！朱喵喵，再見！
