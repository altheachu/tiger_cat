"Tiger" is a hybrid tabby cat. He may be born with American Shorthair blood. His owner is my elder brother, so he is my cute nephew and my parents' lovely grandson. 

He accompanied my family for 13 years, but he went to the heaven 1 year ago. When I had a difficult time, he was always by my side. I always appreciate him, so I made this blog-style website to commemorate him and the happy time he brought to my family.

小虎是一隻有美國短毛貓血統的混血虎斑貓。他是我哥哥養的貓，所以他是我最可愛的外甥，也是我父母的可愛孫子。他陪伴了我們家13年，但1年前他去當小天使了。我記得當我遇到困難時，他總是在我身邊支持我。我非常感激他，所以我製作了這個仿部落格的網站來紀念他及他所帶來歡樂。
