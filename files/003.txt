Tiger's one day start from yowling for asking family members to let him out of his bedroom at 8 o'clock in the morning. After leaving the room, he would keep yowling and running downstairs to the living room. He would patrol the entire 1st floor as if that is his territory. Next, it was time to have his breakfast.
