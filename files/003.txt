Tiger's one day starts from yowling for asking someone, usually my dad, his grandpa to let him out of his bedroom at 8 o'clock in the morning. After leaving the room, he would keep yowling and running downstairs to the living room. He would patrol the entire 1st floor as if that is his territory. Next, it was time to have his breakfast. After breakfast, his behavior would depend on what other family members are doing. 

If my dad is sitting on the sofa and using his ipad, Tiger will lay on his grandpa's thighs and sleep. He will keep interfering and meowing my dad while my dad is using computer. If my mom is sitting on the sofa, he will lean on her and beg for grooming. he will wag his tail softly and fall asleep when my mom is singing. In addition, in a sunny afternoon, he will lay on the wooden bench or my bed to enjoy the sunshine and take a nap.

When he is alone, he will sit down quietly and look the courtyard to feel relaxed. Sometimes he traces and chases small animals such as cockroaches. If he hunt successfully at that time, he is giving his prey as a gift to us while receiving cockroaches is entirely a nightmare for me!

When it is 10 o'clock at night, he will try to hide from my father's search. That's because he do not want to be brought to his room and go to bed. Tiger's one day also end up with yowling for hoping someone release him from the room.

在早上8點，小虎的一天從生氣地嗷嗷叫開始，因為他希望某個人(通常是我爸，也就是他的爺爺)可以放他出臥房。離開臥房後，他會一邊下樓梯、一邊嗷嗷叫，直到抵達一樓的客廳為止。在巡視完整個1樓後，就是吃早餐的時間了。早餐後，他會依據其他人正在做的事決定自己要做什麼。

如果我爸坐在沙發上滑ipad，他就會躺在他爺爺大腿上睡覺。如果我爸在用電腦，他就會一直喵喵叫干擾我爸。如果是我媽坐在沙發上，他就會輕靠著我媽求梳毛。如果我媽正在唱歌，他就會輕輕搖晃著尾巴然後睡著。在晴朗的午後，他會躺在木椅或我的床上享受陽光並睡個午覺。

如果沒有人陪伴他，他會安靜坐著並看著院子去放鬆自我。有時候他會追捕其他小動物(例如蟑螂)，如果獵捕成功，他就會將獵物當作禮物送給我們。雖然我覺得收到蟑螂簡直是場噩夢！

到了晚上10點，他就會試圖躲開我爸，因為他不想被帶去房間睡覺。小虎的一天同樣用嗷嗷叫結束，因為他希望某個人能放他出房間。
