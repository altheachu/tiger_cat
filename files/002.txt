Tiger was still a feral animal when he was a kitten. One day he was severely injured in a terrible car accident. He lost one side of vision and agile motion, so he could not go back and live on the streets anymore. That is why saving volunteers suggested my elder brother to adopt him.

He is lazy, clumsy but very gentle. Like most cats in the world, he spent 16 hours sleeping. He had little interests to chase or hunt anything. Because of the injury, he might fall when he was jumping and running. Sometimes we could not help but laugh, and he would yowl loudly to show his anger. When somebody in my family felt not good, he would lean on and comfort that person.

He accompanied us for 13 years before he died of kidney disease. During his last time on the world, he lived in a hospital in Taipei. My family members in turn spent 1 hour to visit him every day. Since the visiting time always starts from 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I believe he knows what time that he can see us. At his last day, although he was almost out of breath, he still waited until we arrived. He was died in my mother's embrace and family's surrounding. 

小虎小時候是流浪貓，某天他被車撞了，從此他失去了一邊的視力跟貓咪的敏捷性。因此救援中心認為他已經不適合野放，力勸我哥領養他。

小虎是隻雖然懶、雖然笨拙、但是很溫柔的貓。跟大部分的貓咪一樣，他每天花16個小時睡覺，而且他對於追捕狩獵沒有興趣。因為車禍的傷，在跑步或跳躍上，他有時候會不小心跌倒。有幾次我們忍不住大笑，他就會發出「嗷嗷」的怒吼聲。當有人感到低落的時候，他會靠著那個人給予安慰。

小虎總共陪伴了我們13年，最後因腎臟病過世。他在世的最後一段時間，他獨自在台北的醫院接受治療，而我的家人每天輪流花1個小時車程去探視他。醫院的探視時間固定是下午3點開始，我想他也知道哪個時間看得到我們，所以在他的最後一天，儘管他已經呼吸困難，還是撐到了我們抵達的時候。他最後在我媽媽的懷抱跟家人的環繞下辭世。
